1.	A useState (limit) has been declared to dynamically update the limit of comments to be fetched from API payload. Initially 10 comments are loaded in the web application once the component is rendered. When the see more button is clicked, more comments are fetched from the API and the component is rendered again.
2.	Leave Comment text box with Name, Email and Comment field is added to the Component to POST a new comment.  
3.	Once the reply button in the comment is clicked, a text box with whom you are replying to (email: -reply) will be rendered to post a reply to the comment. Conditional check is performed to avoid API calls with empty fields.
