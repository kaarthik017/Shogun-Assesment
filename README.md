# --- Welcome! ---

Thank you for applying for the position of React Support Engineer with Shogun! We are stoked that you applied.

To get started with your application, we would like to see you complete an exercise to evaluate your React skills and knowledge.

## Getting Started
To get started, please clone this repository, or if you do not use Github, go ahead and copy this repo to a service of your choice. If you have any questions, please repond to the email that was sent to you regarding this exercise. Please note an approximate time that this exercise takes to complete, question 6 will ask for this.

## Exercises
Please document the changes that you make to the code, you may change the structure of the code within reason. Design does not count towards evaluation, usability does.
1. Currently the API call has a hardcoded limit for pulling in comments. How could this be made more dynamic? Please change this call so that the `?_limit` attribute makes use of a variable.
2. Create a comment box that allows a new comment to be added to the comment section of the app. You can refer to [this guide](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/guide/) for details on `creating a resource`. This should match the style of the comment boxes currently in place.
3. Add the ability to "reply" to comments - this should be linked to the `reply` button that is already in place. This should create a comment in the newly created comment box starting with "email: -reply", for example, "hayden@example.com: -reply". Optional: you may add the ability to "quote" the comment that you are replying to.
4. Do you have any recommendations on making this code more efficient?
5. In the `map` function of the `CommentSection.js` file, is this violating best practises in any way?
6. How long did this exercise take to complete?
7. Would you like to share any feedback on this exercise?

## Submission
Options:
1. a private gist can be created (or equivalent).
2. a private repo can be created (or equivalent) and shared.

Answers to question 4, 5, and 6 can be sent in reply to the email that you received.

#### Deadline
We understand that you may have another role - ideally, we would receive your solution within a week of receipt. If there is any reason why you can not complete the task within a week, please let us know and we can discuss. 

Note: if a gist is used, there are multiple files that need to be submitted:
- `App.js`
- `CommentSection.js`
- `App.css`, if modified.
- Any other files that were modified or created in the project
